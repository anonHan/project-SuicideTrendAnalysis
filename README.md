# project-SuicideTrendAnalysis

## Introduction

Globally, close to 800,000 people die from suicide every year. Thatâ€™s one person every 40 seconds. According to NCHS Suicide ranks as the fourth leading cause of death for people ages 35 to 54, and the second for 10 to 34 year-olds. It remains the 10th leading cause of death overall. Getting the exact reason behind the suicide is quite challenging because the causes of suicides are complex.
